        Workaround for a design flaw in Pydantic that forces users to accept
        unnecessary garbage in their serialized JSON data or to override
        poorly-documented serialization hooks repeatedly.  Automates overriding said
        poorly-documented serialization hooks for a single dataclass.
        See https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4554 for the relevant dismissive
        comment from the devs. This comment suggests overriding :func:`dict()`, but that
        method was disabled a year later. Now you need to add a custom serializer method
        with a ``@model_serializer`` decorator.
        See the docs at
        https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/functional_serializers/
        for some dubious information on how this API works.
        See comments below for important gotchas that aren't in the documentation.

        determine which dataclass to use for deserialization.
