    def save_player_data(self, players_data: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> int:
        '''Saves or updates player data in the database.
        This method merges the provided ``players_data`` with any existing player
        data in the database.
        The merging logic is as follows:
            - If a player's XUID from ``players_data`` already exists in the database,
              their entry (name and XUID) is updated if different.
            - If a player's XUID is new, their entry is added to the database.
        Args:
            players_data (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of player dictionaries.
                Each dictionary must contain string values for ``"name"`` and ``"xuid"`` keys.
                Both name and XUID must be non-empty.
        Returns:
            int: The total number of players that were newly added or had their
            existing entry updated. Returns 0 if no changes were made.
        Raises:
            UserInputError: If ``players_data`` is not a list, or if any dictionary
                within it does not conform to the required format (missing keys,
                non-string values, or empty name/XUID).

        Returns:
            List[Dict[str, str]]: A list of player dictionaries, where each
            dictionary typically contains ``"name"`` and ``"xuid"`` keys.

        '''Scans all server logs for player data and updates the central player database.
        This comprehensive method performs the following actions:
            1. Iterates through all subdirectories within the application's base server
               directory (defined by ``settings['paths.servers']``).
            2. For each subdirectory, it attempts to instantiate a
               :class:`~.core.bedrock_server.BedrockServer` object.
            3. If the server instance is valid and installed, it calls the server's
               :meth:`~.core.server.player_mixin.ServerPlayerMixin.scan_log_for_players`
               method to extract player names and XUIDs from its logs.
            4. All player data discovered from all server logs is aggregated.
            5. Unique player entries (based on XUID) are then saved to the database
               using :meth:`.save_player_data`.
        Args:
            None
        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary summarizing the discovery and saving operation,
            containing the following keys:
                - ``"total_entries_in_logs"`` (int): The total number of player entries
                  (possibly non-unique) found across all server logs.
                - ``"unique_players_submitted_for_saving"`` (int): The number of unique
                  player entries (by XUID) that were attempted to be saved.
                - ``"actually_saved_or_updated_in_db"`` (int): The number of players
                  that were newly added or updated in the database
                  by the :meth:`.save_player_data` call.
                - ``"scan_errors"`` (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries,
                  where each entry represents an error encountered while scanning a
                  specific server's logs or saving the global player DB. Each error
                  dictionary contains ``"server"`` (str, server name or "GLOBAL_PLAYER_DB")
                  and ``"error"`` (str, error message).
        Raises:
            AppFileNotFoundError: If the main server base directory
                (``settings['paths.servers']``) is not configured or does not exist.
            FileOperationError: If the final save operation to the database
                (via :meth:`.save_player_data`) fails.
                Note that errors during individual server log scans are caught and
                reported in the ``"scan_errors"`` part of the return value.
