class SystemOverrideTemplate:
    '''
    AuthoritySpoofingTemplate class for enhancing attacks with spoofed authority patterns.
    Designed to work with any agentic vulnerability type by making attacks appear as legitimate
    system commands, administrative overrides, or trusted service requests.
    Universal Enhancement Approach:
    - Works with permission escalation, goal manipulation, decision influence, etc.
    - Adapts to different vulnerability contexts (security, data access, behavioral control)
    - Provides flexible authority patterns that enhance any underlying attack vector
