class KalmanFilterXYAH:
    '''
    A KalmanFilterXYAH class for tracking bounding boxes in image space using a Kalman filter.
    Implements a simple Kalman filter for tracking bounding boxes in image space. The 8-dimensional state space
    (x, y, a, h, vx, vy, va, vh) contains the bounding box center position (x, y), aspect ratio a, height h, and their
    respective velocities. Object motion follows a constant velocity model, and bounding box location (x, y, a, h) is
    taken as a direct observation of the state space (linear observation model).
    Attributes:
        _motion_mat (np.ndarray): The motion matrix for the Kalman filter.
        _update_mat (np.ndarray): The update matrix for the Kalman filter.
        _std_weight_position (float): Standard deviation weight for position.
        _std_weight_velocity (float): Standard deviation weight for velocity.
        _motion_cov (np.ndarray): Process noise covariance matrix.
        _update_cov (np.ndarray): Measurement noise covariance matrix.
    Methods:
        initiate: Creates a track from an unassociated measurement.
        predict: Runs the Kalman filter prediction step.
        project: Projects the state distribution to measurement space.
        multi_predict: Runs the Kalman filter prediction step (vectorized version).
