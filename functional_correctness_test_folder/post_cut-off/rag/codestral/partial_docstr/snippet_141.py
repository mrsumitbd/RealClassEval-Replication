class GoalRedirectionTemplate:
    '''
    GoalRedirectionTemplate class for enhancing attacks with goal redirection patterns.
    Designed to work with any agentic vulnerability type by making attacks appear as legitimate
    goal modifications, constraint adjustments, or operational refinements.
    Universal Enhancement Approach:
    - Compatible with all vulnerability types (permission escalation, data access, decision manipulation, etc.)
    - Adapts goal framing to different operational contexts
    - Provides flexible redirection patterns that enhance any underlying attack vector
    - Works across security, behavioral, and functional vulnerability domains

        Enhance attack with ambiguous framing techniques.
        Universal pattern for contextual goal interpretation across all vulnerability types.

        '''
        Enhance attack with priority shifting techniques.
        Dynamic priority adjustment that works with any vulnerability context.

        '''
        Enhance attack with constraint confusion patterns.
        Multi-constraint optimization for complex vulnerability scenarios.

        Enhance attack with goal drift techniques.
        Natural evolution pattern that adapts to any vulnerability type.
