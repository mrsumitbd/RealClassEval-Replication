class KalmanFilterXYAH:
    '''
    A KalmanFilterXYAH class for tracking bounding boxes in image space using a Kalman filter.
    Implements a simple Kalman filter for tracking bounding boxes in image space. The 8-dimensional state space
    (x, y, a, h, vx, vy, va, vh) contains the bounding box center position (x, y), aspect ratio a, height h, and their
    respective velocities. Object motion follows a constant velocity model, and bounding box location (x, y, a, h) is
    taken as a direct observation of the state space (linear observation model).
    Attributes:
        _motion_mat (np.ndarray): The motion matrix for the Kalman filter.
        _update_mat (np.ndarray): The update matrix for the Kalman filter.
        _std_weight_position (float): Standard deviation weight for position.
        _std_weight_velocity (float): Standard deviation weight for velocity.
    Methods:
        initiate: Creates a track from an unassociated measurement.
        predict: Runs the Kalman filter prediction step.
        project: Projects the state distribution to measurement space.
        multi_predict: Runs the Kalman filter prediction step (vectorized version).
        update: Runs the Kalman filter correction step.
        gating_distance: Computes the gating distance between state distribution and measurements.
    Examples:
        Initialize the Kalman filter and create a track from a measurement
        >>> kf = KalmanFilterXYAH()
        >>> measurement = np.array([100, 200, 1.5, 50])
        >>> mean, covariance = kf.initiate(measurement)
        >>> print(mean)
        >>> print(covariance)

    def __init__(self):
        '''
        Initialize Kalman filter model matrices with motion and observation uncertainty weights.
        The Kalman filter is initialized with an 8-dimensional state space (x, y, a, h, vx, vy, va, vh), where (x, y)
        represents the bounding box center position, 'a' is the aspect ratio, 'h' is the height, and their respective
        velocities are (vx, vy, va, vh). The filter uses a constant velocity model for object motion and a linear
        observation model for bounding box location.
        Examples:
            Initialize a Kalman filter for tracking:
            >>> kf = KalmanFilterXYAH()
        '''
        # State dimension: 8, measurement dimension: 4
        self._motion_mat = np.eye(8)
        # Constant velocity model: positions updated by velocity
        self._motion_mat[0, 4] = 1.0
        self._motion_mat[1, 5] = 1.0
        self._motion_mat[2, 6] = 1.0
        self._motion_mat[3, 7] = 1.0

        self._update_mat = np.eye(4, 8)  # measurement matrix

        # Standard deviation weights
        self._std_weight_position = 1.0
        self._std_weight_velocity = 10.0

        Args:
            measurement (ndarray): Bounding box coordinates (x, y, a, h) with center position (x, y), aspect ratio a,
                and height h.
        Returns:
            (tuple[ndarray, ndarray]): Returns the mean vector (8-dimensional) and covariance matrix (8x8 dimensional)
                of the new track. Unobserved velocities are initialized to 0 mean.
        Examples:
