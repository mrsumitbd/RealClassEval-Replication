class GCPRegions:
    """
    A class for managing and analyzing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) regions.
    This class provides functionality to initialize, categorize, and analyze GCP regions based on their
    geographical location, tier classification, and network latency.
    Attributes:
        regions (Dict[str, Tuple[int, str, str]]): A dictionary of GCP regions with their tier, city, and country.
    Methods:
        tier1: Returns a list of tier 1 GCP regions.
        tier2: Returns a list of tier 2 GCP regions.
        lowest_latency: Determines the GCP region(s) with the lowest network latency.
    Examples:
        >>> from ultralytics.hub.google import GCPRegions
        >>> regions = GCPRegions()
        >>> lowest_latency_region = regions.lowest_latency(verbose=True, attempts=3)
