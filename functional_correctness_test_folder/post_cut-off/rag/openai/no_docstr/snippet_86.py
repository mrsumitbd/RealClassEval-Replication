class LetterBox:
    '''
    Resize image and padding for detection, instance segmentation, pose.
    This class resizes and pads images to a specified shape while preserving aspect ratio. It also updates
    corresponding labels and bounding boxes.
    Attributes:
        new_shape (tuple): Target shape (height, width) for resizing.
        auto (bool): Whether to use minimum rectangle.
        scaleFill (bool): Whether to stretch the image to new_shape.
        scaleup (bool): Whether to allow scaling up. If False, only scale down.
        stride (int): Stride for rounding padding.
        center (bool): Whether to center the image or align to top-left.
    Methods:
        __call__: Resize and pad image, update labels and bounding boxes.
    Examples:
        >>> transform = LetterBox(new_shape=(640, 640))
        >>> result = transform(labels)
        >>> resized_img = result["img"]
        >>> updated_instances = result["instances"]

        Initialize LetterBox object for resizing and padding images.
        This class is designed to resize and pad images for object detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation
        tasks. It supports various resizing modes including auto-sizing, scale-fill, and letterboxing.
        Args:
            new_shape (Tuple[int, int]): Target size (height, width) for the resized image.
            auto (bool): If True, use minimum rectangle to resize. If False, use new_shape directly.
            scaleFill (bool): If True, stretch the image to new_shape without padding.
            scaleup (bool): If True, allow scaling up. If False, only scale down.
            center (bool): If True, center the placed image. If False, place image in top-left corner.
            stride (int): Stride of the model (e.g., 32 for YOLOv5).

        '''
        Resizes and pads an image for object detection, instance segmentation, or pose estimation tasks.
        This method applies letterboxing to the input image, which involves resizing the image while maintaining its
        aspect ratio and adding padding to fit the new shape. It also updates any associated labels accordingly.
        Args:
            labels (Dict | None): A dictionary containing image data and associated labels, or empty dict if None.
            image (np.ndarray | None): The input image as a numpy array. If None, the image is taken from 'labels'.
        Returns:
            (Dict | Tuple): If 'labels' is provided, returns an updated dictionary with the resized and padded image,
                updated labels, and additional metadata. If 'labels' is empty, returns a tuple containing the resized
                and padded image, and a tuple of (ratio, (left_pad, top_pad)).
        Examples:
            >>> letterbox = LetterBox(new_shape=(640, 640))
            >>> result = letterbox(labels={"img": np.zeros((480, 640, 3)), "instances": Instances(...)})
