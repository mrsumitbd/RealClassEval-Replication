        '''
        Trivial distance metric that only cares whether the other object is also
        an instance of NullFunc.  Intentionally does not inherit from HARKobject
        as this might create dependency problems.
        Parameters
        ----------
        other : any
            Any object for comparison to this instance of NullFunc.
        Returns
        -------
        (unnamed) : float
            The distance between self and other.  Returns 0 if other is also a
            NullFunc; otherwise returns an arbitrary high number.
