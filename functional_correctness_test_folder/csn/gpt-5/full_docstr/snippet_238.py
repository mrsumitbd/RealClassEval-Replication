I don’t have the class skeleton or requirements. Please provide:
- The class name and full skeleton(methods, attributes, docstrings)
- Expected behavior and edge cases
- Any interfaces/protocols to follow
- Example usage or unit tests
- Constraints(Python version, dependencies, performance expectations)

I’ll implement it accordingly without explanations.
