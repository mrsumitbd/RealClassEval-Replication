I don’t have the class skeleton. Please provide:
- Class name and purpose
- Method signatures(names, params, return types)
- Attributes/properties and their types/defaults
- Expected behavior and edge cases
- Python version and any dependencies
- Sync vs async, threading requirements
- Any constraints(performance, immutability, dataclass usage)
- Sample inputs/outputs or tests

With that, I’ll implement the complete class .
