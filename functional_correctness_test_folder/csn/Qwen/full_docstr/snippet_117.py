        You need to specify the left hand side (lhs) in terms of derivatives

        ----------
        lhs: FinDiff object or combination of FinDiff objects
            the left hand side of the PDE

            the right hand side of the PDE
        bcs: BoundaryConditions
            the boundary conditions for the PDE
