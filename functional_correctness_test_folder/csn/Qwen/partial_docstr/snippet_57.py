class Surv:
    '''A helper class to create a structured array for survival analysis.
    This class provides helper functions to create a structured array that
    encapsulates the event indicator and the observed time. The resulting
    structured array is the recommended format for the ``y`` argument in
    scikit-survival's estimators.

        '''Create structured array from event indicator and time arrays.
        Parameters
        ----------
        event : array-like, shape=(n_samples,)
            Event indicator. A boolean array or array with values 0/1,
            where ``True`` or 1 indicates an event and ``False`` or 0
            indicates right-censoring.
        time : array-like, shape=(n_samples,)
            Observed time. Time to event or time of censoring.
        name_event : str, optional, default: 'event'
            Name of the event field in the structured array.
        name_time : str, optional, default: 'time'
            Name of the observed time field in the structured array.
        Returns
        -------
        y : numpy.ndarray
            A structured array with two fields. The first field is a boolean
            where ``True`` indicates an event and ``False`` indicates right-censoring.
            The second field is a float with the time of event or time of censoring.
            The names of the fields are set to the values of `name_event` and `name_time`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event : str
            Name of the column in ``data`` containing the event indicator.
            It must be a boolean or have values 0/1,
            where ``True`` or 1 indicates an event and ``False`` or 0
            indicates right-censoring.
        time : str
            Name of the column in ``data`` containing the observed time
            (time to event or time of censoring).
        data : pandas.DataFrame
            A DataFrame with columns for event and time.

            The second field is a float with the time of event or time of censoring.
            The names of the fields are the respective column names.
