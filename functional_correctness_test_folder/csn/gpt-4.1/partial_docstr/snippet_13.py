class velocity:
    '''
    Simulates the velocity of a dissipative soliton (kind of self organized particle) [6]_.
    The equilibrium velocity without noise R=0 for
    $    au>1.0/\kappa_3$ is $\kappa_3 \sqrt{(tau - 1.0/\kappa_3)/Q}.
    Before the drift-bifurcation $    au \le 1.0/\kappa_3$ the velocity is zero.
