class ToTensor:
    """Convert a PIL Image or ndarray to tensor and scale the values accordingly.

    This transform does not support torchscript.

    Converts a PIL Image or numpy.ndarray (H x W x C) in the range
    [0, 255] to a torch.FloatTensor of shape (C x H x W) in the range [0.0, 1.0]
    if the PIL Image belongs to one of the modes (L, LA, P, I, F, RGB, YCbCr, RGBA, CMYK, 1)
    or if the numpy.ndarray has dtype = np.uint8

    In the other cases, tensors are returned without scaling.

    .. note::
        Because the input image is scaled to [0.0, 1.0], this transformation should not be used when
        transforming target image masks. See the `references`_ for implementing the transforms for image masks.
