        """Handle a ``NOTIFY`` request by building an `Event` object and
        sending it to the relevant Subscription object.

        A ``NOTIFY`` request will be sent by a Sonos device when a state
        variable changes. See the `UPnP Spec ยง4.3 [pdf]
        <http://upnp.org/specs/arch/UPnP-arch
        -DeviceArchitecture-v1.1.pdf>`_  for details.

        Args:
            headers (dict): A dict of received headers.
            content (str): A string of received content.
        Note:
            Each of the :py:mod:`soco.events` and the
            :py:mod:`soco.events_twisted` modules has a **subscriptions_map**
            object which keeps a record of Subscription objects. The
            *get_subscription* method of the **subscriptions_map** object is
            used to look up the subscription to which the event relates. When
            the Event Listener runs in a thread (the default), a lock is
            used by this method for thread safety. The *send_event*
            method of the relevant Subscription will first check to see
            whether the *callback* variable of the Subscription has been
            set. If it has been and is callable, then the *callback*
            will be called with the `Event` object. Otherwise, the `Event`
            object will be sent to the event queue of the Subscription
            object. The *callback* variable of the Subscription object is
            intended for use only if :py:mod:`soco.events_twisted` is being
            used, as calls to it are not threadsafe.

            This method calls the log_event method, which must be overridden
            in the class that inherits from this class.
