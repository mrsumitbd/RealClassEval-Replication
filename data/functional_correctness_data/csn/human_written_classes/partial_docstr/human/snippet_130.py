    :func:`run_length.encode` compresses an iterable with run-length encoding.
    It yields groups of repeated items with the count of how many times they
    were repeated:

        >>> uncompressed = 'abbcccdddd'
        >>> list(run_length.encode(uncompressed))
        [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)]

    :func:`run_length.decode` decompresses an iterable that was previously
    compressed with run-length encoding. It yields the items of the
    decompressed iterable:

        >>> compressed = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)]
        >>> list(run_length.decode(compressed))
        ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd', 'd']
