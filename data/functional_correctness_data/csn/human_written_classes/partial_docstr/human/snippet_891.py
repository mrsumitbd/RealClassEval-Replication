class Closure:
    """A very simple callback class to emulate a closure (reference to
    a function with arguments) in python.

    This class holds a user-defined function to be executed when the
    class is invoked as a function.  This is useful in many situations,
    especially for 'callbacks' where lambda's are quite enough.
    Many Tkinter 'actions' can use such callbacks.

    >>>def my_action(x=None):
    ...    print('my action: x = ', x)
    >>>c = Closure(my_action,x=1)
    ..... sometime later ...
    >>>c()
     my action: x = 1
    >>>c(x=2)
     my action: x = 2

    based on Command class from J. Grayson's Tkinter book.
