class SharedCounter:
    """A synchronized shared counter.

    The locking done by multiprocessing.Value ensures that only a single
    process or thread may read or write the in-memory ctypes object. However,
    in order to do n += 1, Python performs a read followed by a write, so a
    second process may read the old value before the new one is written by
    the first process. The solution is to use a multiprocessing.Lock to
    guarantee the atomicity of the modifications to Value.

    This class comes almost entirely from Eli Bendersky's blog:
